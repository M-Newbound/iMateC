# Chess Engine in C

This project is a basic chess engine written from scratch in the C programming language.

## How to Run

Note: This project is currently a work in progress. The compilation and execution instructions will be provided once the project is complete.

## Why I Undertook This Project
### Interest in Algorithm Design

I have a strong interest in algorithm design and optimization. Developing a chess engine from scratch provided a perfect opportunity to delve deep into complex algorithms such as minimax and alpha-beta pruning, which are essential for building an efficient chess engine.

### Challenge of Implementing Game AI

Creating an AI that can play chess at a reasonable level of competence is a unique and rewarding challenge. It involves understanding not only the rules of chess but also strategies for evaluating board positions and making decisions based on incomplete information.

## What I Learned
### Advanced Algorithmic Techniques

I learned how to implement advanced algorithmic techniques such as minimax search, alpha-beta pruning, and iterative deepening. These techniques are critical for creating a competitive chess engine and have broader applications in other areas of computer science.
### Efficient Data Structures

Building a chess engine required the use of efficient data structures for representing the chessboard, moves, and game state. I gained experience with bitboards, linked lists, and hash tables, which improved my ability to choose and implement the right data structure for a given problem.
### Performance Optimization

Performance is crucial in a chess engine to search as many moves as possible within a limited time. I learned various optimization techniques, including bit manipulation, memory management, and low-level optimizations, to enhance the performance of the engine.
### Understanding of Game Theory

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of game theory, particularly concepts related to zero-sum games, evaluation functions, and heuristic development. This knowledge is valuable for designing AI systems that can make decisions in adversarial environments.
### Debugging Complex Systems

Developing a chess engine from scratch involved debugging complex interactions between various components of the system. I improved my debugging skills, learning how to systematically identify and fix issues in a large codebase.
## What I Would Do Differently
- **Enhance the Evaluation Function**: Develop a more sophisticated evaluation function to improve the engine's playing strength, incorporating advanced heuristics and machine learning techniques.
- **Parallelize the Search Algorithm**: Implement parallel processing to take advantage of multi-core processors, significantly speeding up the move search process.
- **Improve User Interface**: Create a graphical user interface to make the game more accessible and visually appealing for users.
- **Expand Testing Framework**: Develop a comprehensive testing framework to ensure the engine's stability and correctness across a wide range of positions and scenarios.
